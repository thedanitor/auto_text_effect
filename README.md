# Auto Text Effect

https://thedanitor.github.io/auto_text_effect/

This project is from the Day 30 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have added some comments to the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what particular lines of code do.

### Overall Impression

Did not realize how simple it would be to create a text typing effect. I will definitely try to implement this in React.

### Things Learned

* Can create number box with value arrows by ```<input type="number" name="speed" id="speed" value="1" min="1" max="5" step="1">```
